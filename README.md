# ShellfireVPN-Android

## üöÄ Overview

ShellfireVPN-Android is an open-source Android application that provides a secure and private VPN connection. This repository contains the latest **clean** version, though it still includes proprietary extensions. The changes for F-Droid compatibility will be implemented later.

Repository Location: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shell-fire/shellfire-vpn.android/tree/main/app)

## üìå Features

- Secure VPN connection with encryption
- Open-source and privacy-focused
- Currently includes proprietary extensions
- F-Droid compatibility planned for the future
- Optimized for Android devices

## üì• Installation

You can install ShellfireVPN-Android in the following ways:

### **1. From Google Play**

- Download the latest version from the Google Play Store: [ShellfireVPN on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.shellfire.vpn.android)

### **2. From F-Droid (Coming Soon)**

- The F-Droid version is free from proprietary dependencies.
- Link to F-Droid will be added soon.

### **3. Build from Source**

You can manually build the app using Android Studio:

#### **Prerequisites:**

- Android Studio (latest version)
- Java JDK 11+
- Android SDK with necessary dependencies

#### **Build Instructions:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shell-fire/shellfire-vpn.android.git
cd shellfire-vpn.android

# Open in Android Studio and build
```

## üîë Secure Signing Setup

To ensure security, the signing keys are **not included** in this repository. You must configure your own signing credentials:

1. **Create ********`local.properties`******** file in the root directory:**

```
storeFile=C:\Users\YOUR_USER\keystore.jks
storePassword=YOUR_PASSWORD
keyAlias=YOUR_ALIAS
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
```

2. The app will automatically use these credentials when building **locally**.

## üîí Privacy & Security

We prioritize privacy. The app:

- Currently includes proprietary extensions.
- Will later be modified to exclude proprietary dependencies for F-Droid.
- **Includes proprietary crash analytics** but does **not** use user analytics (e.g., Firebase Analytics, Google Analytics, etc.).
- Is fully open-source and auditable.
- To comply with F-Droid policies, crash analytics will be replaced with an open-source alternative in the future (e.g., **ACRA** or **self-hosted Sentry**).
