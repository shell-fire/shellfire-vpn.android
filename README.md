## üîë Secure Signing Setup
To ensure security, the signing keys are **not included** in this repository. You must configure your own signing credentials:

1. **Create `local.properties` file in the root directory:**
```
storeFile=C:\Users\YOUR_USER\keystore.jks
storePassword=YOUR_PASSWORD
keyAlias=YOUR_ALIAS
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
```
2. The app will automatically use these credentials when building **locally**.

## üîí Privacy & Security
We prioritize privacy. The app:
- Currently includes proprietary extensions.
- Will later be modified to exclude proprietary dependencies for F-Droid.
- Does **not** use proprietary analytics (Firebase, Google Analytics, etc.).
- Is fully open-source and auditable.
